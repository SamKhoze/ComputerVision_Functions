# ComputerVision_Functions
This Computer Vision guidance covers some of the well-known concepts of computer vision functions 


Popular datasets such as ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and MNIST can be used as the basis for creating image datasets and Dataloaders. Popular image transforms such as random rotation, random crop, random horizontal or vertical flipping, normalization, and color augmentation can be used to create model-ready data. Dataloaders can be used to efficiently load batches of data from the dataset for model training.
